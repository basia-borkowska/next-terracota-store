    "story": "As the days grow shorter and the air turns crisp, our homes naturally become sanctuaries of warmth and comfort. Cozy autumn interiors celebrate earthy tones, tactile fabrics, and the simple joy of slowing down. This season, layering textures is key: soft wool blankets draped across armchairs, linen tablecloths paired with ceramic tableware, and plush rugs that invite you to walk barefoot even on chilly mornings.\n\nLighting also takes center stage. Lamps with linen shades and warm bulbs create an intimate atmosphere, perfect for evenings spent with a book or a quiet dinner.",
